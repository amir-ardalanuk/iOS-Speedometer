# Speedometer iOS - Code Coverage 70%

I've tried to develop an application that had more than 50% code coverage. the purpose of this app gets the speed of the user from location services by a delegate. another feature is get limited speed from the user and if your speed passes the limit make your controller aware with delegate.
Unit-test is my goal for this project and Test-Driven code was my challenge.
